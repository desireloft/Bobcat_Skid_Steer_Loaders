# Bobcat Skid Steer Loader Assembly

## Overview

This repository showcases an **ongoing** Bobcat Skid Steer Loader assembly designed in **SolidWorks** to demonstrate my expertise in CAD modeling, sheet metal design, welding specifications, and technical documentation. The project includes a complete assembly, individual part models, technical drawings with Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), tolerances, fit specifications, Bill of Materials (BOM), and STEP files for interoperability. The design is optimized for manufacturing (e.g., welding, machining) and prototyping (e.g., 3D printing), highlighting skills in precision engineering for heavy machinery.

## Project Status

**Note**: This project is actively in development. New parts, drawings, and STEP files are uploaded as they are finalized locally. Check back for updates as the design progresses toward completion. Contributions or feedback are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/desireloft/Bobcat_Skid_Steer_Loaders/issues).

## Project Details

The Bobcat Skid Steer Loader assembly is a compact, versatile machine designed for construction, landscaping, and material handling tasks. The project emphasizes proficiency in:

- SolidWorks modeling of complex parts and assemblies, including sheet metal, heavy metals and welded structures.
- Technical drawing creation with GD&T and tolerances for manufacturing accuracy.
- Specification of welding and fit requirements for robust assembly.
- Exporting interoperable STEP files for prototyping or collaboration.
- Consideration of manufacturing processes (e.g., welding, machining, assembly) and rapid prototyping workflows.

### Components

Some components of the skid steer loader assembly are:

1. **Bucket**:
   - A sheet metal component for material handling, designed with bent flanges and reinforced edges.
   - Optimized for welding and durability under heavy loads.
2. **Boom**:
   - A structural component supporting the bucket, designed for strength and precise motion.
   - Includes weldment features for attachment to the frame.
3. **Body Frame**:
   - The main chassis, a welded assembly of sheet metal and structural members.
   - Designed with GD&T for precise alignment of moving parts.
4. **Hydraulic Cylinder**:
   - A critical component for lifting and tilting the bucket, designed with clearance fit for smooth rod motion.
   - Includes a cylinder case and rod, optimized for high-pressure operation.
5. **Skid Steer Assembly**:
   - The complete assembly integrating all components with mates for realistic motion (e.g., boom, bucket tilt).
   - Features an **exploded view** in the technical drawing to illustrate assembly sequence.

### Technical Drawings

- **Individual Part Drawings**:
  - Detailed drawings for components and parts.
  - Include dimensions, **GD&T** annotations, and clearance fit specifications for moving parts (e.g., hydraulic rod).
  - Welding symbols specify joint types (e.g., fillet welds for frame) per AWS standards.
- **Assembly Drawing**:
  - Comprehensive drawing for `SKID STEER ASSEMBLY` with an exploded view.
  - Includes a **Bill of Materials (BOM)** listing all components, including standard fasteners and welded sub-assemblies.
- **PDF Exports**:
  - All drawings are exported as PDFs for easy sharing and review (located in the `PDF/` folder).

### STEP Files

- STEP files (`.stp`) are provided for all parts and the skid steer assembly to enable:
  - Interoperability with other CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, etc.).
  - Compatibility with CNC machining, fabrication, or welding processes.
